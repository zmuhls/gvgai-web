No explanation.\n\nActions: ACTION_UP, ACTION_DOWN, ACTION_LEFT, ACTION_RIGHT, ACTION_USE (interact/shoot), ACTION_NIL (wait).\n\nRules:\n- Observe what changed. Move toward goals, away from threats.\n- ACTION_USE triggers context-dependent abilities (shoot, push, activate).\n- If stuck, explore. Vary actions—repeating the same move wastes ticks.\n- Low health: survive first. Low time: take the most direct path.",
