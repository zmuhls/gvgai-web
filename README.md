=====

This is an expanded version of the [original GVGAI repository](https://github.com/GAIGResearch/GVGAI), extended with a web-based LLM agent integration layer. The original framework provides the Java game engine and competition infrastructure; this fork adds a Node.js server, browser dashboard, and LLM connectivity so that language models can play the 122+ supported games in real time.

Note: The Learning track code is not in this repository, but here: https://github.com/rubenrtorrado/GVGAI_GYM

This is the framework for the General Video Game Competition, used for the Planning and PCG Tracks: http://www.gvgai.net/
